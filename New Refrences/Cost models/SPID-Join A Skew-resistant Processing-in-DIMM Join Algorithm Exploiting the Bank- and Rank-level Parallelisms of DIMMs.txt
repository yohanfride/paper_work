#Problem
- The existing PID join algorithms achieve low performance and scalability with skewed input tables. 
- 

#Idea:
Present SPID-Join, a skew-resistant PID join algorithm which exploits two parallelisms inherent in DIMM architectures, namely bank- and rank-level parallelisms.
In this paper, we present SPID-Join, a skew-resistant PID join algorithm which exploits two parallelisms inherent in DIMMs, namely bank- and rank-level parallelisms, to mitigate the inter-IDP load imbalance and achieve high skew resistance. The key idea of SPID-Join is to allocate higher internal memory bandwidth and computational throughput to each join key by replicating join keys across ranks and across the banks within a rank.
