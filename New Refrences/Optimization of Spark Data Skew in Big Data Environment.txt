1. Abstract
#proposed idea:
- Skew model that can quantify the degree of data skew. 
- A shuffle partition scheme is proposed to optimize data skew in Spark distributed platform 

2. Introduction
# Experts agree with the problems of existing technologies
The Spark framework itself has not taken effective countermeasure against the data skew problem, during the shuffle phase of Spark

#goal 
the optimization of Spark â€™s shuffle mechanism is a very worthy topic to investigate.
