#Issues:
Frameworks (Spark/Hive) still remain vulnerable to communication costs, data skew and tasks imbalance problems.


#Proposed Idea: 
In this paper, we present a new GroupBy-Join algorithm allowing to reduce communication costs considerably while avoiding data skew effects. 

#Concern: 
- Join operation is performed in the first step and then the group-by operation.
- Assume that queries may be significantly reduced if the group-by operation and aggregate function are performed before the join
- [Design Principles] Thus, reducing the size of relations to be joined helps in reducing the communication cost and by consequence in reducing the execution time of queries in parallel and distributed systems. [Used it for pushing down filtering]
