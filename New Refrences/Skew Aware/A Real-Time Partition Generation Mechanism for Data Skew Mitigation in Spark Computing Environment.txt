1. Abstract

#Trend of existing technologies
Due to the limitation of the computing power of a single node, big data is usually processed on a distributed parallel processing framework

#Experts agree with the problems of existing technologies
Data skew will seriously affect the performance of distributed parallel computing, causing excessive load on some tasks and idle computing resources. 

# Proposed Idea
Propose an optimization method based on step size sampling, which can more accurately predict the distribution of intermediate data.


2. Introduction
#Tech Issues
- Excellent partitioning strategy needs to
consider the problem of the unbalanced distribution of
computing resources
- How to alleviate data skew
