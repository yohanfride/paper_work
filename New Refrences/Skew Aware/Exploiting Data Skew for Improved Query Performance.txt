1. Abstract
#Trend of existing technologies:
Data skew is a ubiquitous feature of these real-world domains. In a retail database, some products are typically much more popular than
others.

#Experts agree with the problems of existing technologies:
Current systems do not make the most of caches for exploiting skew. In particular, a whole cache line may remain cache resident even though only a small part of the cache line corresponds to a popular data item.

#goal:
Index structure for repositioning data items to concentrate popular items into the same cache lines

#Contribution:
- theoretical model for analyzing the cache utilization, and 
- implement database operators that are efficient in the presence of skew.
