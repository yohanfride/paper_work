1. Abstract:
#Trend of existing technologies:
Spark has been continuously developed and popularized. It reduces the data transmission time through efficient memory-based operations

# Experts agree with the problems of existing technologies
-  In Spark, data skew is very prominent due to the uneven
distribution of input data and the unbalanced allocation of default partitioning algorithm. When data skew occurs, the execution efficiency of the program will be reduced, especially in the
reduce stage of Spark

#Goal
Proposes ReducePartition to solve data skew problem at reduce stage of Spark platform.

2. Introduction
# trends:
a large number of parallel computing frameworks for data processing
have emerged.
