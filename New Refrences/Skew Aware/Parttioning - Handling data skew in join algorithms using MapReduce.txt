#Issues: 
 One of the major obstacles hindering effective join processing on MapReduce is data skew. 

#(drawback)Current method:
  - range-based: does not handle join product skew
  - randomized: performs worse than the basic hash-based partitioning 

#Proposed:
  - In this paper, we present a new skew handling method, called multi-dimensional range partitioning (MDRP), to overcome the limitations of the methods. We extend range partitioning by adopting the cross-product space from random partitioning.
